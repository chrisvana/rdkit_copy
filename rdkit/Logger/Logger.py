      **Arguments:**

             which is used to log the actual invocation of a method

        - obj: the object which is calling the method

        - method: the *name* of the method to be invoked

class Logger(object):
  """ This is the actual wrapper class.

    The wrapper is fairly thin; it only has one methods of its own:

      - _LoggerGetLog()

    and then several instance variables:

      - _loggerFlushCommand

      - _loggerClass

      - _loggerObj

      - _loggerCommandLog

      - _loggerIgnore

    These names were chosen to minimize the likelihood of a collision
     with the attributes of a wrapped class.  Obviously... ;-)

    The general idea of using this is that you wrap a class in the logger,
      and then use the class as you normally would.  Whenever you want to 
      get the contents of the log (for example after running your program for
      a while), you can call _loggerCommandLog.  The resulting list can be
      played back in another (or the same) object using the replay() function
      defined below.

    The logger can, optionally, be set to flush its log whenever a method with
      a particular name is invoked.  For example, you may want to be wrapping
      some kind of drawing canvas and want to reset the log whenever the canvas
      is cleared because there's no point in storing commands which will have
      no effect on the final drawing.

    **Note**

      because of the way I've worked this, the log will actually be flushed
      whenever the client program accesses the flush method, it need not be invoked.
      i.e. if the loggerFlushCommand is 'foo', then doing either wrappedObj.foo() or
      wrappedObj.foo will reset the log.  This is undesirable and will most likely
      be fixed in a future version
